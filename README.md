Study timer that rewards studying with image creation


FocusArc is a program centered around rewarding and tracking hard work with something tangible, a picture. Every hour a 20x20 block is placed onto a 200x200 canvas, after 100 hours (or 40,000 pixels) the user will be done building their picture and it will be placed in their gallery. 

Features
- Timer-based productivity tracker
- Unlockable images as an incentive to keep studying
- Gallery of all completed images
- Profile screen with the total stats of the user
- Elegant, dark academia design

Installation
1. You will need Python 3.10+

2. Clone or download the repo

3. Install dependencies through:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the app:

python main.py

Dependencies
- Kivy
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy
- playsound

Usage
Start the app and select "Begin", you will have three options from there. "Profile" will take you to your user profile where you can see the total amount of time you have studied. "Gallery" will take you to your gallery where you can see all your completed pictures. Finally "Study" will take you to the study timer, the main feature. Here you will be able to set the time you want to study for, once set a black box will appear and a countdown for the next block reveal will ensue.

What I learned:
This project began as a simple study timer, but over time as more ideas came into my head I put in the time to learn the libraries needed to put my vision together. Learning new tools like Kivy for UI and NumPy for image manipulation were fun and made me realize how much I can do with Python. Anything I imagine can be created if I know the right things to type. I'm very excited to keep working on more projects in the future and honing in my skills as a amateur full stack software developer.
